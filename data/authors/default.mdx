I enjoy the process of coding, liking the feeling of building blocks, especially when writing elegant code. As a web developer, I focus on front-end, mobile, and back-end development. My tech stack includes Vue3, React, Flutter, NestJS, and other technologies. I am also skilled in hybrid development based on Flutter, including developing iOS and Android plugins and integrating third-party SDKs.

**Front-end development:**

Vue3 and React are the main frameworks I use for developing webpages. Seeing my applications being used by others gives me a great sense of achievement.

**Application development:**

Experience in using Flutter for hybrid development, capable of developing iOS and Android plugins, and smoothly integrating various third-party SDKs. Also have experience using React Native and Ionic.

**Backend development:**

Mainly developed using node.js. Proficient in developing RESTful APIs using NestJS. Utilize Prisma for database connections. Also have experience with koa2 and Sequelize.

Outside of work, I love outdoor activities, including hiking, trekking, cycling, and working out. I also enjoy camping with friends, and appreciate the tranquility and beauty of nature.
